With the emergence of Web3, we have seen how new technologies such as DeFi, NFT, and tokens have gradually entered common use. Defi provides compelling advantages over traditional finance along the verticals of decentralization, access, efficiency, interoperability, and transparency. However, even with these advantages and the advancement of Web3, the common user misses the great opportunity that exists in DeFi due to the difficulty in the user experience, complexity, and the number of things to do and information on DeFi. The web3 adoption started with DeFi, but to get to the next 1 billion users, we need something more. 

For many, the next big revolution comes from social web3. Social web3 wants to give users back control over their data on social networks. There are several new protocols focused on this. One of these protocols is [Lens-protocol](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/what-is-lens). Lens allows us to build social networks through NFT. The Profile NFT is the main object in the Lens Protocol. It is ownership over this NFT that gives you control of your content. The Profile NFT contains the history of all of the posts, mirrors, comments, and other content you generate. Something interesting about Lens is that it allows us to program and interact with contracts when, for example, following another profile.

For us, a social network is the next killer app for web3. Now, imagine combining the power of a social network with existing DeFi protocols. Social DeFi was built to demonstrate that it is possible to use DeFi protocols in an entertaining and different way without the user noticing the complexity of what is going on.
